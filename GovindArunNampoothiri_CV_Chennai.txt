Projects
Banking Customer Retention: Causal Targeting Engine [Demo] [GitHub]
• Engineered a Causal Inference framework (T-Learner/XGBoost) to address a ”Hard Market” (75% Neutrals),
achieving a 3.2x Global Lift and ∼86% reduction in marketing waste by utilising Behaviour-Based Segmentation
to isolate the 14.4% ”Persuadable” segment while filtering out ”Sure Things” and ”Sleeping Dogs”.
• Deployed a production MLOps pipeline using FastAPI and Docker for real-time inference, coupled with an interactive
Streamlit dashboard for stakeholders to visualize Qini Curves and simulate budget allocation scenarios.
• Validated causal reliability using DoWhy refutation tests (Placebo Treatment) and SHAP, ensuring the stability
of Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) and model interpretability for stakeholder trust.
Real-Time Payment Fraud Detection System [GitHub]
• Architected a hybrid AD-RL-GNN framework that integrates Adaptive Majority Downsampling with an
autonomous RL agent, achieving a 22.7% improvement in G-Means (57.21%) over baseline by recovering
complex fraud patterns in highly imbalanced (28:1) data.
• Engineered a scalable training pipeline using PyTorch Geometric NeighborLoader and FAISS, enabling the
processing of 590k+ transaction nodes on a single T4 GPU (preventing OOM) while maintaining <28ms P95
inference latency (27.84ms) for real-time deployment.
• Deployed production-ready API using FastAPI, Docker, and Redis, incorporating MLflow for model versioning
and reproducibility, with automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), integrated with GNNExplainer to
provide regulatory-compliant feature attribution for every flagged transaction.
Work Experience
FITTLYF | Data Science Intern Nov 2023 - Mar 2024
• Designed end-to-end A/B testing platform enabling creation, execution, and analysis of experiments, reducing
average time-to-decision by 40% (from experiment launch to actionable recommendation) through automated
statistical analysis and streamlined reporting workflows.
• Accelerated experiment metadata retrieval by 15% via Streamlit-based Central Experiment Management Tool
within the platform, enabling users to review past experiments and reuse configurations across new A/B tests
through search and filtering.
• Engineered A/B and Multivariate Testing tool using NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Plotly and Streamlit, achieving
25% lower false positive rate in statistical tests vs. market solutions (validated via simulation on 1000 synthetic
experiments) through advanced distribution handling and sequential testing methods.
• Shipped production A/B testing platform in 6 weeks across data engineering and frontend teams, handling statistical
computation, API design, and UI/UX workflows end-to-end.
• Reduced experiment bias investigation time by 10% (validated with 5 internal users) through organization-level
and experiment-level SRM detection dashboards in Tableau, enabling faster decision-making on whether to
continue, pause, or invalidate experiments based on real-time sampling health monitoring.
